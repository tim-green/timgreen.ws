        I have been working for the last 4 years in agencies, startups and as a
        freelancer. I worked in two continents, designed apps, landing pages,
        websites, ads, posters, emails for a wide range of clients.
      </p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">
        My approach is realistic and creative, supported by skills in frontend
        development (HTML, CSS, PHP, Js, Wordpress). I'm able to create
        traditional and new creative solutions for any communicational issue.

        As a designer my enthusiasm lies in creating delightful interactive
        experiences. To do this, I come equipped with creative designs grounded
        in user sensibilities, a persistent attitude towards producing better work
        and an easy going, ego-free approach towards my peers.

        I'm currently a full time member of Opendoor's design team.
        Aside of that I'm also curating a website showcase called <a href="http://lablacklist.co/">lablacklist.co</a>
        and a <a href="http://slevinsky.tumblr.com/">moodboard</a>. I rarely write, but when I do, it
        happens <a href="http://slrncl.com/journal/">here</a>. When I hear something short and smart, I take a note <a href="http://slrncl.com/notetoself/">here</a>.
