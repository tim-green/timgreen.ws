# A bit about my website
I've completely rewritten and changed the layout of my website. 

This site has been built with PHP, CSS, a mixture of both jQuery and JavaScript, also I didn't use a CMS.


I've used Grunt to perform common tasks when developing this site. 

I've included a dark colour scheme for those users who have set dark mode on their devices so it will look a 

bit different from light mode.

## What I need to do List
Add possibly a resume link to a pdf

Convert CSS into SASS
